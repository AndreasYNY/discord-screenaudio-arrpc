    <p>
      A very WIP custom discord client that supports streaming with audio on
      Linux, made possible by the
      <a href="https://github.com/edisionnano/Screenshare-with-audio-on-Discord-with-Linux" >
        great work
      </a>
      of <a href="https://github.com/edisionnano">@edisionnano</a> and the
      <a href="https://github.com/Soundux/rohrkabel">Rohrkabel</a> library by
      <a href="https://github.com/Curve">@Curve</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is
      <b>not</b>
      to provide an alternative to the original Discord client. Rather, it
      should be used in addition to the original client in case you want to
      stream something, maybe used with a second account. For anything else,
      this client has way too many things that work less well than in the
      original client.
